# Tim's Diner

A School Python Project to manage the orders and menu for a restaurant.

It is designed to:
- Take 20 Hours
- Challenge Students in the GCSE curriculum.

It is set by Pearson Edexcel, and the instructions set is attached in `instructions.pdf`.

## Setup

The project uses the `json`, `os`, and `time` modules.

The modules come with Python’s standard utility module, so there is no need to install them externally.

However, do note that the project was written using `Python 3.10.8`.

The project also clears the screen in the terminal, which is dependant on the OS.

Change the variable on `line 7` in `main.py` based on your operating system like so:
```python
clear_command = "cls" #This is for the Windows.
clear_command = "clear" #This is for the Unix systems.
```

When ready, just run the following in the terminal of the directory where the files are stored:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Licsense
This project uses the Unlicsense. This means you are free to use this code however you like.
